## User-Agent Expression properties

- `Name`: The name of the expression. It is used to identify the rule and have no effect on the rule itself.
- `Operator`: The operator of the expression. It can be set to `equals`, `does not equals`, `contains`, `does not contain` and `regex match`.
- `Value`: The value of the expression. It can be set to any string. The default value is your current User-Agent. If you are using `regex match`, the value should be a regular expression.
