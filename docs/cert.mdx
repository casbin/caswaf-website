If your website supports HTTPS access, you need to configure an SSL certificate in CasWAF to enable it to establish a secure connection with your server as a reverse proxy.

This section will provide a detailed explanation of the properties and usage of `Cert`.

## Cert properties

### Basic Information

- `Owner`: The owner of the certificate (organization or user).
- `Name`: The name of the certificate.
- `DisplayName`: The display name of the certificate.
- `CreatedTime`: The timestamp when the certificate was created.

### Certificate Configuration

- `Type`: The type of the certificate. This field is usually set to `SSL` since SSL is the most commonly used option.
- `CryptoAlgorithm`: The cryptographic algorithm of the certificate. It can be set to `RSA` or `ECC` which depends on the algorithm your certificate uses.
- `ExpireTime`: The expiration time of the certificate. This field will be automatically filled in when you set certificate and private key.
- `DomainExpireTime`: The expiration time of the domain registration (if available from WHOIS lookup).
- `Certificate`: The certificate content.
  - The certificate is a public key that has been authenticated by a Certificate Authority (CA).
- `PrivateKey`: The private key content.
  - The private key is a secret key that is used to encrypt and decrypt data.

### Automatic Certificate Management (ACME)

CasWAF supports automatic certificate generation and renewal using ACME providers:

- `Provider`: The DNS provider for automatic certificate management. Supported providers include `Aliyun` (Alibaba Cloud) and `GoDaddy`.
- `Account`: The account identifier for the ACME provider.
- `AccessKey`: The access key or API key for authenticating with the DNS provider.
- `AccessSecret`: The access secret or API secret for authenticating with the DNS provider (masked in UI for security).

## Manage Certificates

In the Certs page, you will see all certs you have created. You can create, edit, delete and view the cert details. But now we don't have any certs.

## Add a cert

Just click the `Add` button, you will create a cert. The created cert will have some default information that you can modify.

## Edit cert

After you create a site, you can click the `edit` button to edit the site.

Each field's meaning is as described above, and you can freely modify them according to the actual situation of your website.

After you have completed the modifications, you only need to click the `Save` button to save your settings.
