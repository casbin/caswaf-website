CasWAF uses Casdoor to manage members. So you need to create an organization and an application for CasWAF in a Casdoor instance.

## Requirements

### OS

All major operating systems including Windows, Linux and macOS are supported.

### Environments

- [Go 1.17+](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [Node.js LTS (16 or 14)](https://nodejs.org)
- [Yarn 1.x](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

:::info
We strongly suggest you use [Yarn 1.x](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) to run & build CasWAF frontend, using NPM might cause UI styling issues, see more details at: [casdoor#294](https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor/issues/294)

:::caution
For **Chinese** users, in order to download the Go dependency packages successfully, you need to use a Go proxy by Configuring the GOPROXY environment variable. We strongly recommend: <https://goproxy.cn/>

## Download

The source code of CasWAF is hosted at GitHub: <https://github.com/casbin/caswaf>. Both the Go backend code and React frontend code are inside the single repository.

| Name | Description | Language | Source code |
| ----|------|----|---- |
| Frontend | Web frontend UI for CasWAF | Javascript + React | <https://github.com/casbin/caswaf/tree/master/web> |
| Backend | RESTful API backend for CAsWAF | Golang + Beego + MySQL | <https://github.com/casbin/caswaf> |

CasWAF supports Go Modules. To download the code, you can just simply clone the code both via `go get` and `git`:

```bash
go get github.com/casbin/casdoor
go get github.com/casbin/caswaf
```

or

```bash
git clone https://github.com/casbin/casdoor
git clone https://github.com/casbin/caswaf
```

## Necessary configuration

### Set up database

CasWAF will store its users, nodes and topics information in a MySQL database named: `caswaf`. CasWAF will create it if not existed. The DB connection string can be specified at: <https://github.com/casbin/caswaf/blob/master/conf/app.conf>

```ini
dataSourceName = root:123@tcp(localhost:3306)/
```

CasWAF uses XORM to connect to DB, so all DBs supported by XORM can also be used.

### Configure Casdoor

After creating an organization and an application for CasWAF in a Casdoor, you need to update `clientID`, `clientSecret`, `casdoorOrganization` and `casdoorApplication` in app.conf and Conf.js to change the configuration.

- Backend (conf/app.conf)

```ini
casdoorEndpoint = <Your Casdoor endpoint>
clientId = <Your Casdoor application's client ID>
clientSecret = <Your Casdoor application's client secret>
casdoorOrganization = <Your Casdoor organization name>
casdoorApplication = <Your Casdoor application name>
```

- Frontend (web/src/Conf.js)

```js
serverUrl: "<Your Casdoor endpoint>"
clientId: "<Your Casdoor application's client ID>"
appName: "<Your Casdoor application name>"
organizationName: "<Your Casdoor organization name>"
```

More details about Casdoor configuration can be found at: [casdoor-sso](/docs/casdoor-sso)

### Run CasWAF

- Build backend of CasWAF
  - `go build github.com/casbin/caswaf`
- Build frontend of CasWAF
  - `yarn start`
- Now you can visit CasWAF configuration website at:
  - `http://localhost:16001/`

## Optional configuration

### Set up your WAF to enable some third-party login platform

CasWAF uses Casdoor to manage members. If you want to log in with oauth, you should see [casdoor oauth configuration](https://casdoor.org/docs/category/oauth).

### OSS, Mail, and SMS services

CasWAF uses Casdoor to upload files to cloud storage, send Emails and send SMSs. See Casdoor for more details.
