CasWAF provides a Compound rule feature to help you control the access of your website. With Compound rules, you can combine multiple rules with logical operators to create complex access control policies.

## Compound Expression properties

- `Logic`: The logical operator of the compound rule. It can be set to `and` or `or`, and the first rule in the compound rule will be ignored if the logical operator is `begin`. During expression evaluation, `and` has a higher priority than `or`. For example, `A and B or C` is equivalent to `(A and B) or C`.
- `Rule`: The rules that need to be combined.
