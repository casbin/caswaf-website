`Site` is representing the real applications or websites you wish to protect.

This section will provide a detailed explanation of the properties and usage of `Site`.

## Site properties

### Basic Information

- `Owner`: The owner of the site (organization or user).
- `Name`: The name of the site.
- `DisplayName`: The display name of the site.
- `CreatedTime`: The timestamp when the site was created.
- `UpdatedTime`: The timestamp when the site was last updated.

### Domain Configuration

- `Domain`: The primary domain of the site.
  - e.g. `blog.example.com`
- `OtherDomains`: Additional domains for the site. This allows multiple domains to point to the same site.
- `Tag`: A tag or label for organizing sites.

### Host and Network Settings

- `Host`: The host of the site (legacy setting for single backend).
  - e.g. `localhost:8080`
- `Hosts`: Multiple backend hosts for load balancing. If specified, CasWAF will randomly select one from the list.
- `Port`: The port number of the backend service.
- `PublicIp`: The public IP of the site (if available).
- `Node`: The name of the host on which the site is deployed.
- `Nodes`: Information about all nodes running this site, including status, version, and process details.
- `Status`: The current status of the site (e.g., Active, Inactive).

### Security and Rules

- `Rules`: The rules used in the site to handle requests. Users can select the rules from the dropdown list.
  - About how to add rules, please refer to [Rule List](/docs/rule).
- `NeedRedirect`: Whether to redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS.
- `DisableVerbose`: Whether to disable verbose logging for this site.

### SSL/TLS Configuration

- `SslMode`: The SSL mode of the site. It can be `HTTP` or `HTTPS and HTTP` or `HTTPS Only`.
  - `HTTP`: The site is not using SSL. Users can access the site **only** via HTTP.
  - `HTTPS and HTTP`: The site is using SSL and HTTP. Users can access the site via **both** HTTP and HTTPS.
  - `HTTPS Only`: The site is using SSL only. Users can access the site **only** via HTTPS. If users access the site via HTTP, they will be redirected to HTTPS.
- `SslCert`: The SSL certificate of the site. User can select the SSL certificate from the dropdown list.
  - About how to add SSL certificate, please refer to [SSL Certificates](/docs/cert).

### Alert Configuration

- `EnableAlert`: Whether to enable health check alerts for this site.
- `AlertInterval`: The interval (in seconds) between health check attempts.
- `AlertTryTimes`: The number of consecutive failed health checks before triggering an alert.
- `AlertProviders`: List of alert providers to notify when health checks fail.

### Authentication and Advanced Settings

- `CasdoorApplication`: If your site needs OAuth login, you can select the Casdoor app from the dropdown list.
  - CasWAF uses Casdoor as the OAuth server. So you need to register your site as a Casdoor app first.
  - About how to add Casdoor app, please refer to [Casdoor SSO](/docs/casdoor-sso).
- `ApplicationObj`: The populated Casdoor application object (automatically filled).
- `Challenges`: ACME challenges for automatic SSL certificate generation (used internally).
