`Record` represents individual HTTP requests that have been processed by CasWAF. These records provide visibility into traffic patterns, security events, and can be used for analysis and troubleshooting.

This section will provide a detailed explanation of the properties and usage of `Record`.

## Record properties

### Basic Information

- `Id`: The unique identifier of the record (auto-generated).
- `Owner`: The owner of the record (organization or user).
- `CreatedTime`: The timestamp when the request was recorded.

### Request Information

- `Method`: The HTTP method of the request (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- `Host`: The host header of the request, indicating which site received the request.
- `Path`: The URL path of the request (e.g., `/api/users`, `/index.html`).
- `ClientIp`: The IP address of the client making the request.
- `UserAgent`: The User-Agent string from the request headers, identifying the client browser or application.

## Usage

Records are automatically created by CasWAF when processing requests, especially when rules are triggered or when verbose logging is enabled. They provide valuable insights for:

- **Security Monitoring**: Track blocked requests and potential attacks.
- **Traffic Analysis**: Understand usage patterns and popular endpoints.
- **Troubleshooting**: Debug issues with specific requests or client configurations.
- **Compliance**: Maintain audit logs of access to protected resources.

### Viewing Records

Records can be viewed in the CasWAF admin interface, where they can be filtered and searched by various criteria such as IP address, path, or time range.

### Metrics and Analytics

CasWAF provides built-in analytics based on record data:

- Top requesting IP addresses
- Most accessed paths
- User-Agent distribution
- Traffic trends over time (hourly, daily, monthly)

These metrics help administrators understand their traffic patterns and identify potential security threats or performance issues.
